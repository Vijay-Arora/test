# test
This is just to test whether the git is working properly through my Git Bash Command Line.
As I am new to Git so, just trying things out.
If anyone is new I'd recommend to do it and solve the issues on their own that would give you confidence.
If you still face any challenges you can first create a new repository then go to the Git Bash and follow the commands.
